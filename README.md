# Action-RPG
FYI - The reason I don't have seperate '/Engine/' and '/Game/' folders is because I don't plan on making this a 'modularized' engine codebase and just have it tightly integrated with the game, besides, its still in very early stages so... yeah.  

Some random ARPG Game I'm working on

## Inspiration
* CrossCode  
* Terraria  
* Stardew Valley 
  
Hello! If you're reading this - hi! I've currently put the project on hold for now since I don't think the actual framework architecture is good enough. I'm going to learn more before I get back to it :)

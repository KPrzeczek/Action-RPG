# Action-RPG
Taking things more slowly this time. Hopefully this turns out better.  
  
FYI - The reason I don't have seperate '/Engine/' and '/Game/' folders is because I don't plan on making this a 'modularized' engine codebase and just have it tightly integrated with the game, besides, its still in very early stages so... yeah.

# Inspiration
* CrossCode  
* Terraria  
* Stardew Valley
